# Unit 14 HW

## Part 1: Reflection

- Reflect on what you have achieved so far in this course and answer the following questions:

### The Journey so Far
1. What have you learned so far?

- It's actually a bit complicated when I really think about it. I've learned a lot from the purely technical standpoint by really immersing myself in the world of code and seeing what it's really like, but there are personal things as well. Given the nature of this course I've learned more about self-discipline in this kind of setting and I've also learned the mindset that is really necessary in this kind of work. There really is a lot more time spent thinking about problems and verbalizing them; discussing them too; than there is literally just writing code. I think I've also learned more about the kind of pacing I can really keep up with, and the density of the material that goes along with it.

2. What have you accomplished?

- I've learned a lot more technical skills a lot faster than I thought I could, and I have the course to thank really. It's incredibly valuable to have something that lays out what you need to know and how to learn it, as figuring that out is often the hardest part of learning anything. I'm quite proud of some things that are in retrospect simple, just because of the kind of problem solving that went into it and how cool it feels to make, and how relieving it felt to finally find solutions. I'm honestly still most proud of the password generator assignment because I never would have known how to conceptualize something like that in code and I think mine looked cool as well as had a lot of my own solutions built from scratch put into it. I've managed to stay healthy while keeping up with the workload and understanding quickly enough to stay afloat. That might be the most important thing I've accomplished, given my nature and the long rest times I often feel I need.

3. Think back to the first week, how have you changed and grown since then?

- I think I've settled into what I'm doing, for better and for worse. I was a lot more strict with myself early on, but once I settled I've found I don't need to be so hardcore because, while it might be more efficient, it's no way to live after a point. I found the happy balance of doing what I need to do while staying sane and under just the right amount of stress to not be too relaxed, but also not be unhealthy. I've gained a lot more confidence in going into the unknown and researching on my own to find solutions to technical problems. It's still very tough, but I've grown a bit more used to just trying things I can find out even if they don't make sense, because just by trying it out, even when it seems like you have so little information, often leads to figuring out a solution through attrition, when you couldn't have even imagined how it would have worked.

### Path to Success
1. What are your goals for the remainder of the course?

- For one... to complete it of course. Most importantly though, to maintain the pace I have now or even grow into a better disciplined pace and learn more new concepts outside of the course material while I'm still in it.

2. What do you hope to accomplish before the course completes?

- I would really hope to gain a lot more confidence in this field in general. I want to feel that I can navigate whatever I have to technically and learn anything I need to to solve any problem or create anything I can imagine.

3. What do you hope to accomplish after the course completes?

- I want to build something I can really be happy with, and know is a good idea that will attract many people. I also want to know that I can contribute to building just about anything with code or build anything I want to myself. I also hope to train myself to a point of feeling confident applying for any professional position in this field.

4. What strategies will you employ to ensure you accomplish these goals?

- I've started trying to make a habit out of solving one problem a day, or trying to learn even a little bit of something new each day. Even something like just writing code for 5 minutes, which, if you make the effort to do, will often turn into doing a lot more than that. It's amazing what you can do if you just focus for even a half hour or so. I remember reading that the average person can finish something like 50 books a year if they just read for 45 minutes a day. That's so little, it seems like, and yet that's so much more than most people do in the long run. I try to take this kind of thinking to heart and make it a habit to always be improving at someting and learning a little each day, without making it feel like hard work and a grind. It should be an art form and in your nature.

5. How do these plans and goals differ from the first half of the course?

- It's hard to say really as my core philosophies are largely the same. The main thing is that there are more specific resources laid out for me to use after becoming aware of things like leetcode or specific books like cracking the coding interview, or a udemy course or two. I also have a community now, which means there's always people around that can help keep the momentum going by making code and all the ideas behind it a regular thing in my life. That's very important to improving. Surrounding yourself with the subject matter and people who are also working with it constantly. There's really no replacement for it in my experience.
